# Time Series Analysis and Forecast

**welcome to my repo :)**

## General Description

this is a _Python_ machine learning project that uses several Time Series librairies like [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), a python module that provides several statistical models and tests, [fbprophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) which is an open source software released by Facecbook's data science team used to forecast Time Series and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) the popular Python machine learning library.

the Project contains 3 main parts :

1. Basic data analysis and data preparation
2. [Arima](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-arima.asp) and [Auto-Arima](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/auto-arima-time-series-modeling-python-r/#:~:text=Auto%20ARIMA%20takes%20into%20account,the%20better%20is%20the%20model.) models
3. Prophet model
4. Linear Regression

## Technology

> the python code is written in a JupyterNotebook
